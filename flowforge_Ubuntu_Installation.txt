Local Install
This version of the FlowForge platform is intended for running on a single machine for a smaller deployment (e.g. evaluation or home user)



Prerequisites
Operating System
The install script has been tested against the following operating systems:

Raspbian/Raspberry Pi OS versions Buster/Bullseye [1]
Debian Buster/Bullseye
Fedora 35
Ubuntu 20.04
CentOS 8/RHEL 8/Amazon Linux 2
MacOS Big Sur & Monterey on Intel & Apple M processors




Node.js
FlowForge requires Node.js v16.

Linux
The install script will check to see if it can find a suitable version of Node.js. If not, it will offer to install it for you.

It will also ensure you have the appropriate build tools installed that are often needed by Node.js modules to build native components.




Windows/MacOS
If the install script cannot find a suitable version of Node.js, it will exit.

You will need to manually install it before proceeding. Information about how to do this can be found on the Node.js website here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

You will also need to install the appropriate build tools.

Windows: the standard Node.js installer will offer to do that for you.
MacOS: you will need the XCode Command Line Tools to be installed. This can be done by running the following command: xcode-select --install





Installing FlowForge
1.Create a directory to be the base of your FlowForge install. For example: /opt/flowforge or c:\flowforge

For Linux/MacOS:
sudo mkdir /opt/flowforge
sudo chown $USER /opt/flowforge


2.Download the latest Installer zip file into a temporary location.

3.Unzip the downloaded zip file and copy its contents to the FlowForge directory




For Linux/MacOS:
Assumes /tmp/ is the directory where you downloaded flowforge-installer.zip

cd /tmp/
unzip flowforge-installer.zip
cp -R flowforge-installer/* /opt/flowforge


4.Run the installer and follow the prompts

For Linux/MacOS:

cd /opt/flowforge
./install.sh


Installing as a service (optional)
On Linux, the installer will ask if you want to run FlowForge as a service. This will mean it starts automatically whenever you restart your device.

If you select this option, it will ask if you want to run the service as the current user, or create a new flowforge user. If you choose to create the user, it will also change the ownership of the FlowForge directory to that user.



Configuring FlowForge

The default FlowForge configuration is provided in the file flowforge.yml

Linux/MacOS: /opt/flowforge/etc/flowforge.yml

The default configuration file already contains everything you need to get started with FlowForge.
It will allow you to access FlowForge and the Node-RED instances you create, from the same server running the platform. If you want to allow access from other devices on the network, you must edit the configuration file and change the host setting to 0.0.0.0 and change base_url to contain the IP address of the server.

NOTE: We do not support changing the host and base_url values once you have created an instance.



Running FlowForge

To run it manually, you can use:
Linux/MacOS:

/opt/flowforge/bin/flowforge.sh

Or to run as a service:

Linux

service flowforge start




First Run Setup

Once FlowForge is started, you will be ready to perform the first run setup

Following a successful install, you will be able to access the platform to go through the initial setup.
